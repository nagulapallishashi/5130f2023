WEB SECURITY AND SOLUTIONSAfter a lot of consideration, I have decided to write a term paper on Web security and its solutions. The rapid evolution of the internet has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate. In this digital age, web applications have become an integral part of our daily lives, facilitating everything from online shopping to social networking, and from banking to healthcare. However, the convenience and connectivity offered by the web have also given rise to a myriad of security challenges. Ensuring the security of web applications is now a fundamental imperative, as the threats they face are as diverse and dynamic as the online world itself.This paper is dedicated to exploring the multifaceted realm of web security, dissecting its challenges, and presenting effective solutions. It delves into the core principles of web security, which encompass preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of web resources. By addressing these principles, web security seeks to shield against cyber threats, ranging from data breaches and denial-of-service attacks to injection vulnerabilities and more.
